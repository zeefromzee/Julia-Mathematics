# Julia Plotting Examples

`⋆｡˚ ☁︎ ˚｡⋆｡˚🦋˚｡⋆｡˚☁︎˚｡⋆`
*math curves, cute plots, and Julia scripting!*
`⋆｡˚ ☁︎ ˚｡⋆｡˚♡˚｡⋆｡˚☁︎˚｡⋆`

Welcome to a collection of charming mathematical plots made with Julia!  
Here you’ll find code and SVGs for classic and whimsical curves—from hearts (♡) to butterflies (🦋).  
Whether you’re curious about math art, want to learn plotting, or just like pretty pictures, have a look around!

## What’s inside? (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)♡

- **Sine and Cosine curves**
- **Heart curves** (yes, like this: ♡)
- **Lissajous curves**
- **Butterfly curves** (fluttering right in your browser: 🦋)
- **Rose curves** and more!

All plots are generated using small Julia scripts and saved as SVGs for easy sharing and remixing.

## Getting started (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

You’ll need Julia and these packages:
- Plots
- GraphRecipes
- Graphs

Install with:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Plots")
Pkg.add("GraphRecipes")
Pkg.add("Graphs")
```

Run the main script:

```bash
julia juli.jl
```

SVG images will appear in your folder—ready to view, share, or add to this README!
